00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.309
Welcome to chance of Life, the game in which

2
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.899
you get to live 30 days in somebody else's life.

3
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.799
Each time we pick a person and fact from a country around the world.

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.799
So get excited,

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.599
They come from all kinds of places.

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.699
Hit start when you're ready.

7
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.599
Today you're going to be living in Madagascar.

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.099
And the person you get to be is Lalaina.

9
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.399
So today is day one and Lalaina just got paid.

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.599
That means you get to start well loaded for the month.

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.799
Lalaina is a construction worker in the city of Toliara,

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.699
which means that like 90% of the people here,

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.299
he gets paid minimum wage or less.

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.399
Lalaina gets minimum wage.

15
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.799
So here's your budget, $55.

16
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.399
Alright, so Lalaina has a small family:

17
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.799
his wife Tantely and their daughter Malala,

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.299
who is four years old.

19
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.499
Neither of them work,

20
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.599
So Lalaina has to take care of them too.

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.199
Ready?

22
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.199
GO!

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.399
All right, the electricity bill came in.

24
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.399
You haven't used too much power nor water last month.

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.899
Do you want to pay the bill today, or maybe later?

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.599
Choosing to pay later will cause the power to cut.

27
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.699
Your daughter Malala didn't go to school last month.

28
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.899
You have enough money to put her in school this month.

29
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.999
It's only eight dollars.

30
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.199
Do you want to?

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.699
When she doesn't go to school,

32
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.799
you can use your money for other things.

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.489
On the other side, an education will help her

34
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.499
get a good job when she grows up.

35
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.899
The food provisions are running out.

36
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.899
Let's get some more.

37
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.299
Now, you usually get a large bag of rice with beans.

38
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.899
Would you like to get some meat this month?

39
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.899
That would be $8.

40
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.399
Sometimes rice and beans don't have enough nutrition.

41
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.499
However, they're cheaper, just $4.

42
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.199
Your daughter is getting sick.

43
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.499
She's got the flu.

44
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.099
Let's take her to the hospital.

45
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.699
The doctor would only charge you $5.

46
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.999
Maybe we can also just treat her at home

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.299
with some hot water and sleep.

48
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.799
Tantely is worried about her father in a village nearby.

49
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.799
He's getting very old and sick.

50
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.699
Should you buy a ticket for her to see him?

51
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.099
The tickets to go and come back are only $7.

52
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.599
Or you could wait for maybe next month.

53
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.289
Lalaina's friends came over

54
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.999
and invited him to go out for drinks tonight.

55
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.599
Everybody chips in a bit to get the party going.

56
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.599
Should we go?

57
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.399
Your last phone broke over two months ago.

58
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.199
While walking to work this morning,

59
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.499
You came across this really good deal.

60
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.699
It's a bit old but it makes calls and sends messages.

61
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.599
Lalaina wants to get it.

62
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.899
What do we do?

63
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.999
It's very affordable, it's only $10,

64
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.299
but maybe you think that can wait.

65
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.799
A new store opened in town

66
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.199
and Lalaina found this toy there.

67
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.699
He wants to get it from Malala his daughter.

68
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.799
It's only $3.

69
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.899
Should he get it?

70
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.099
Malala doesn't have that many toys.

71
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.199
She usually plays outside.

72
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.699
She knows this game that's using rocks.

73
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.999
It's pretty fun!

74
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.399
You've been using a very bad iron at home,

75
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.599
and it sometimes stains the family's clothes.

76
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.599
Luckily,

77
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.499
you found this electric one at a second-hand store

78
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.699
and good news:

79
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.599
It's only $4!

80
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.499
The old iron you use uses charcoal.

81
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.799
This would be such an upgrade.

82
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.499
It's nearly the end of the year

83
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.399
and your taxes came through.

84
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.399
You don't have too many expenses.

85
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.199
So it shouldn't add up to much.

86
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.499
Hey, they're only $5.

87
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.199
You've got this weekend off from work.

88
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.299
You could take your family to the beach to relax.

89
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.399
It's only a couple miles away.

90
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.899
So the whole trip would cost only five dollars.

91
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.299
What do you think?

92
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.889
After a long month of working hard,

93
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.599
five dollars is worth it.

94
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.499
But then again, it's still money.

95
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.299
Lalaina wants to surprise Tantely with a gift,

96
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.499
and he found the best deal: a bag.

97
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.689
It looks like pretty good quality

98
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.499
without being too expensive.

99
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.389
This bag is four dollars

100
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.299
and it will replace the old bags

101
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.999
you got years ago.

102
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.199
So should we get it for $4?

103
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.299
You hurt your leg while working.

104
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.599
It might need some medical attention.

105
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.699
Getting it treated at the hospital would cost $15.

106
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.499
On the flip side,

107
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.699
you can try traditional oils for just $4.

108
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.999
But in that case, we can't be sure you'll get better.

109
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.499
What should we do?

110
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.289
You ran out of money before

111
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.599
the end of the month.

112
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.299
Your brother helped you make that last purchase,

113
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.699
but from now until the next paycheck,

114
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.899
you're going to have to subsist without money.

115
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.999
You have some food provisions,

116
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.599
but be really careful not to get sick

117
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.199
or want anything

118
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.189
or do anything else

119
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.099
that could increase your expenses.

120
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.799
There is no restart button in life.

121
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.799
Now, It's out of your control

122
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.499
whether you'll make it or not.

123
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.599
Luckily you made it to the next month

124
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.199
your paycheck came in today.

125
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.298
Do you want to try again?
